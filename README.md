# chess-api

This project makes use of the `chess-processor` and `chess-ui` repositories to implement a chess application which enables users to not only play local chess matches but also remotely across different devices.

## How to setup

1. Rename/Copy .env.template to .env
2. Run `docker-compose up` (you might want to add the `-d` flag to detach)
